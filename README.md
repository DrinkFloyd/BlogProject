# BlogProject
A personal rails project

Shematics go like this:
There's a dashboard, with an index. This is the main page of the site.
It will have the following:
  -A list of all posts ever posted by all users, most recent on the top, first post on the bottom
  -A post has/ can have:
    -A related image
    -A 1000 character limit
    -Up to 3 attachments (.docx, .txt, .png, .jpg, .mov, .mp3)
  -A user can:
    -Create new posts, Read all posts, Update or Destroy their own posts.
    -A user has:
      -A username, (Screen Name), an email (hidden unless selected by the user to be displayed), a password, and a personal Bio.

That is the basis for this project.
The main page is the first step, and it's most like a random section on an image board.
Other pages for different categories will probably be created.
